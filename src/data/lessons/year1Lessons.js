Two plus three equals five!



4️⃣ + 1️⃣ = 5️⃣

Four plus one equals five!



3️⃣ + 2️⃣ = 5️⃣

Three plus two equals five!



1️⃣ + 1️⃣ = 2️⃣

One plus one equals two!



2️⃣ + 2️⃣ = 4️⃣

Two plus two equals four!



3️⃣ + 1️⃣ = 4️⃣

Three plus one equals four!



## Fun Activities

This is a story about a naughty rabbit named Peter.

## Peter's Adventure

Once upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.

Their mother told them, "You may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden!"

Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail were good little bunnies and went down the lane to gather blackberries.

But Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's garden!

He ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate some radishes. And then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.

But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor!

Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, ‘Stop thief!’

Peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.

After a long chase, Peter finally found the gate and slipped underneath. He ran home as fast as he could go.
