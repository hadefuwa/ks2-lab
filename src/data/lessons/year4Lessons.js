Let's learn to multiply larger numbers!



## What is Long Multiplication?



Long multiplication helps us multiply numbers with more than one digit.



## Example: 23 × 4



\`\`\`

23

×  4

---

92

\`\`\`



Step by step:

1. Multiply 4 × 3 = 12 (write 2, carry 1)

2. Multiply 4 × 2 = 8, add the carried 1 = 9

3. Answer: 92



## Example: 34 × 12



\`\`\`

 34

×  12

---

 68  (34 × 2)

+ 340  (34 × 10)

---

408

\`\`\`



## Practice



Try these:

- 45 × 6 = ?

- 23 × 7 = ?

- 56 × 8 = ?

- 34 × 9 = ?



## Fun Activities

Let's learn about fractions and decimals!



## Fractions



Fractions show parts of a whole.



- ½ = one half

- ¼ = one quarter

- ⅓ = one third

- ¾ = three quarters



## Decimals



Decimals are another way to show parts of a whole.



- 0.5 = half (same as ½)

- 0.25 = quarter (same as ¼)

- 0.75 = three quarters (same as ¾)

- 0.1 = one tenth



## Converting Fractions to Decimals



- ½ = 0.5 (1 ÷ 2 = 0.5)

- ¼ = 0.25 (1 ÷ 4 = 0.25)

- ⅓ = 0.333... (1 ÷ 3 = 0.333...)

- ¾ = 0.75 (3 ÷ 4 = 0.75)



## Place Value in Decimals



- 0.1 = one tenth

- 0.01 = one hundredth

- 0.001 = one thousandth



## Practice



Convert these:

- ½ to decimal

- ¼ to decimal

- ¾ to decimal

- 0.5 to fraction



## Fun Activities



- Practice converting fractions

- Use number lines

- Compare fractions and decimals

- Solve problems with both



## Remember



- Fractions and decimals show parts

- They can be converted

- Practice helps you understand

print("Hello", "World")
print("My", "name", "is", "Python")
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
Hello World
My name is Python
\`\`\`

## Printing Numbers

You can print numbers without quotes:

\`\`\`python
print(5)
print(10)
print(3 + 2)
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
5
10
5
\`\`\`

## Combining Text and Numbers

\`\`\`python
print("I am", 8, "years old")
print("2 + 2 =", 2 + 2)
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
I am 8 years old
2 + 2 = 4
\`\`\`

## Special Characters

### New Line

Use \`\\\\n\` to start a new line:

\`\`\`python
print("Line 1\\\\nLine 2\\\\nLine 3")
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
\`\`\`

### Tabs

Use \`\\\\t\` to add a tab (spacing):

\`\`\`python
print("Name:\\\\tAlice")

\`\`\`
Hello, Alice
Alice is learning Python
\`\`\`

## Math with Variables

\`\`\`python
apples = 5
oranges = 3
total = apples + oranges

print("I have", total, "fruits")
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
I have 8 fruits
\`\`\`

## Changing Variables

You can change what's stored in a variable:

\`\`\`python
score = 10
print("Score:", score)

score = 20
print("New score:", score)
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
Score: 10
New score: 20
\`\`\`

## Variable Names

Good variable names:
- Use lowercase letters
- Use underscores for spaces
- Be descriptive

**Good examples:**
\`\`\`python
student_name = "Alice"
number_of_apples = 5
total_score = 100
\`\`\`

**Bad examples:**
\`\`\`python
x = "Alice"  # Not clear what x means
n = 5        # Not descriptive
\`\`\`

## Practice Examples

### Example 1: Personal Info

\`\`\`python
my_name = "Python Learner"
my_age = 8
my_school = "Code Academy"

print("Name:", my_name)
print("Age:", my_age)
print("School:", my_school)
\`\`\`

### Example 2: Shopping

\`\`\`python
apples = 3
bananas = 5
oranges = 2

total_fruits = apples + bananas + oranges
print("Total fruits:", total_fruits)
\`\`\`

### Example 3: Calculations

\`\`\`python
length = 10
width = 5
area = length * width

print("Length:", length)
print("Width:", width)
print("Area:", area)
\`\`\`

## Try It Yourself

1. Create variables for your name, age, and favorite color

      content: `# Python Lesson 4: Input & Interaction ⌨️

## Making Programs Interactive

So far, our programs just display messages. Now let's make them interactive by getting input from the user!

## The Input Function

The \`input()\` function lets users type information into your program.

## Basic Input

\`\`\`python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello,", name)
\`\`\`

**What happens:**
1. Program asks: "What is your name? "
2. User types their name
3. Program says hello

## Getting Different Types of Input

### Text Input

\`\`\`python
favorite_color = input("What is your favorite color? ")
print("I like", favorite_color, "too!")
\`\`\`

### Number Input

**Important:** \`input()\` always returns text, even for numbers!

\`\`\`python
age = input("How old are you? ")
print("You are", age, "years old")
\`\`\`

To do math with numbers, convert them:

\`\`\`python
age = int(input("How old are you? "))
next_year = age + 1
print("Next year you will be", next_year)
\`\`\`

## Converting Input Types

### String to Integer

\`\`\`python
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
double = number * 2
print("Double is", double)
\`\`\`

### String to Float

\`\`\`python
price = float(input("Enter a price: "))
tax = price * 0.1
print("Tax is", tax)
\`\`\`

## Building Interactive Programs

### Example 1: Greeting Program

\`\`\`python
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")

print("Hello,", name)
print("You are", age, "years old")
print("Nice to meet you!")
\`\`\`

### Example 2: Calculator

\`\`\`python
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))

total = num1 + num2
print("The sum is", total)
\`\`\`

### Example 3: Story Maker

\`\`\`python
name = input("Enter a name: ")
place = input("Enter a place: ")
animal = input("Enter an animal: ")

print("Once upon a time,", name)
print("went to", place)
print("and met a", animal)
\`\`\`

## Combining Input and Variables

\`\`\`python
# Get information
name = input("What is your name? ")
favorite_food = input("What is your favorite food? ")
times_per_week = int(input("How many times per week do you eat it? "))

# Calculate
times_per_month = times_per_week * 4

# Display results
print(name, "eats", favorite_food, times_per_month, "times per month!")
\`\`\`

## Practice Examples

### Example: Personal Quiz

\`\`\`python
print("Let's learn about you!")

name = input("What is your name? ")
age = int(input("How old are you? "))
favorite_subject = input("What is your favorite subject? ")

print("\\\\nHere's what I learned:")
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Favorite subject:", favorite_subject)
\`\`\`

## Try It Yourself

1. Create a program that asks for your name and says hello
2. Make a simple calculator that adds two numbers
3. Create a story maker that asks for words and makes a story
4. Build a quiz about yourself

## Important Notes

- \`input()\` always returns text (strings)
- Use \`int()\` to convert to whole numbers
- Use \`float()\` to convert to decimal numbers
- Always provide clear prompts for users
- Test your programs with different inputs`,
      quizId: quizId++,
      assessmentType: 'quiz',
      categoryId: 'python',
    }),

    new Lesson({
      id: lessonId++,
      yearId: 'year4',
      subjectId: 'technology',
      lessonNumber: 5,
      title: "Python Lesson 5: Decisions (if statements)",
      emoji: '🤔',
      content: `# Python Lesson 5: Decisions (if statements) 🤔

## Making Choices

Programs need to make decisions, just like we do! Python uses \`if\` statements to make choices.

## Basic If Statement

\`\`\`python
age = 8

if age >= 8:
    print("You can ride the roller coaster!")
\`\`\`

**What's happening?**
- \`if\` checks a condition
- \`age >= 8\` means "age is 8 or more"
- If true, the code inside runs
- Notice the colon \`:\` and indentation!

## Comparison Operators

- \`==\` equals (is the same)
- \`!=\` not equals (is different)
- \`>\` greater than
- \`<\` less than
- \`>=\` greater than or equal
- \`<=\` less than or equal

## Examples

### Checking Numbers

\`\`\`python
score = 85

if score >= 80:
    print("Great job!")
\`\`\`

### Checking Text

\`\`\`python
color = input("What is your favorite color? ")

if color == "blue":
    print("Blue is a great color!")
\`\`\`

## If-Else Statements

Use \`else\` for when the condition is false:

\`\`\`python
age = 7

if age >= 8:
    print("You can ride!")
else:
    print("Sorry, you're too young")
\`\`\`

## If-Elif-Else

Use \`elif\` (else-if) for multiple conditions:

\`\`\`python
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("Excellent!")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Great job!")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Good work!")
else:
    print("Keep practicing!")
\`\`\`

## Multiple Conditions

### Using \`and\`

Both conditions must be true:

\`\`\`python
age = 10
has_ticket = True

if age >= 8 and has_ticket:
    print("You can enter!")
\`\`\`

### Using \`or\`

Either condition can be true:

\`\`\`python
day = "Saturday"

if day == "Saturday" or day == "Sunday":
    print("It's the weekend!")
\`\`\`

## Practice Examples

### Example 1: Age Checker

\`\`\`python
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

if age >= 13:
    print("You are a teenager")
elif age >= 8:
    print("You are a child")
else:
    print("You are very young!")
\`\`\`

### Example 2: Grade Calculator

\`\`\`python
score = int(input("Enter your score: "))

if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
else:
    grade = "Keep trying!"

print("Your grade is", grade)
\`\`\`

### Example 3: Password Checker

\`\`\`python
password = input("Enter password: ")

if password == "python123":
    print("Access granted!")
else:
    print("Access denied!")
\`\`\`

## Try It Yourself

1. Create a program that checks if a number is positive or negative
2. Make a weather program that gives advice based on temperature
3. Build a simple password checker
4. Create a program that checks if you can vote (age 18+)

## Important Notes

- Always use a colon \`:\` after \`if\`, \`elif\`, and \`else\`
- Indent code inside if statements (use 4 spaces)
- \`==\` checks if equal, \`=\` assigns a value
- Use \`and\` for both conditions, \`or\` for either condition
- Test your conditions with different values`,

      emoji: '🔄',
      content: `# Python Lesson 6: Loops 🔄

## What are Loops?

Loops let you repeat code without typing it over and over. They make programs efficient and powerful!

## For Loops

A \`for\` loop repeats code a specific number of times.

### Counting

\`\`\`python
for i in range(5):
    print("Hello!")
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
\`\`\`

### Using Range

\`\`\`python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
0
1
2
3
4
\`\`\`

**Note:** \`range(5)\` goes from 0 to 4 (5 numbers total)

### Range with Start and End

\`\`\`python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
1
2
3
4
5
\`\`\`

### Range with Steps

\`\`\`python
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
0
2
4
6
8
\`\`\`

## Looping Through Lists

\`\`\`python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print("I like", fruit)
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
I like apple
I like banana
I like orange
\`\`\`

## While Loops

A \`while\` loop repeats as long as a condition is true.

### Basic While Loop

\`\`\`python
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print("Count is", count)
    count = count + 1
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
Count is 0
Count is 1
Count is 2
Count is 3
Count is 4
\`\`\`

### User Input Loop

\`\`\`python
answer = ""

while answer != "yes":
    answer = input("Do you want to continue? (yes/no): ")
    print("You said:", answer)
\`\`\`

## Nested Loops

Loops inside loops:

\`\`\`python
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(i, j)
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
0 0
0 1
1 0
1 1
2 0
2 1
\`\`\`

## Practice Examples

### Example 1: Countdown

\`\`\`python
for i in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(i)
print("Blast off!")
\`\`\`

### Example 2: Multiplication Table

\`\`\`python
number = 5

for i in range(1, 11):
    result = number * i
    print(number, "x", i, "=", result)
\`\`\`

### Example 3: Sum Numbers

\`\`\`python
total = 0

for i in range(1, 6):
    total = total + i
    print("Adding", i, "Total is now", total)

print("Final total:", total)
\`\`\`

### Example 4: Guessing Game

\`\`\`python
secret = 7
guess = 0

while guess != secret:
    guess = int(input("Guess the number (1-10): "))
    if guess < secret:
        print("Too low!")
    elif guess > secret:
        print("Too high!")

print("You got it!")
\`\`\`

## Try It Yourself

1. Print numbers from 1 to 10
2. Print the 5 times table
3. Create a program that counts from 10 down to 1
4. Make a guessing game
5. Print your name 5 times using a loop

## Important Notes

- \`for\` loops repeat a specific number of times
- \`while\` loops repeat while a condition is true
- Always indent code inside loops
- Be careful with \`while\` loops - make sure they can end!
- Use \`range()\` to control how many times a loop runs`,

      emoji: '⚙️',
      content: `# Python Lesson 7: Functions ⚙️

## What are Functions?

Functions are reusable pieces of code. Instead of writing the same code over and over, you write it once in a function and use it whenever you need it!

## Why Use Functions?

- **Reuse code**: Write once, use many times
- **Organize code**: Break problems into smaller pieces
- **Easier to fix**: Change code in one place
- **Cleaner programs**: Makes code easier to read

## Creating Functions

### Basic Function

\`\`\`python
def greet():
    print("Hello!")
    print("Welcome to Python")

greet()
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
Hello!
Welcome to Python
\`\`\`

### Function with Parameters

Parameters are information you give to the function:

\`\`\`python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello,", name)
    print("Nice to meet you!")

greet("Alice")
greet("Bob")
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
Hello, Alice
Nice to meet you!
Hello, Bob
Nice to meet you!
\`\`\`

### Function with Return

Functions can give back (return) a value:

\`\`\`python
def add(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result

sum = add(5, 3)
print("The sum is", sum)
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
The sum is 8
\`\`\`

## Function Examples

### Example 1: Calculator Functions

\`\`\`python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

# Use the functions
result1 = add(10, 5)
result2 = subtract(10, 5)
result3 = multiply(10, 5)

print("10 + 5 =", result1)
print("10 - 5 =", result2)
print("10 * 5 =", result3)
\`\`\`

### Example 2: Greeting Function

\`\`\`python
def greet(name, age):
    print("Hello,", name)
    print("You are", age, "years old")
    print("Have a great day!")

greet("Alice", 8)
greet("Bob", 10)
\`\`\`

### Example 3: Area Calculator

\`\`\`python
def rectangle_area(length, width):
    area = length * width
    return area

def circle_area(radius):
    area = 3.14 * radius * radius
    return area

# Calculate areas
rect = rectangle_area(5, 3)
circle = circle_area(4)

print("Rectangle area:", rect)
print("Circle area:", circle)
\`\`\`

## Built-in Functions

Python has many built-in functions you can use:

\`\`\`python
# len() - get length
name = "Python"
print(len(name))  # Output: 6

# max() - get maximum
numbers = [5, 2, 8, 1]
print(max(numbers))  # Output: 8

# min() - get minimum
print(min(numbers))  # Output: 1

# abs() - absolute value
print(abs(-5))  # Output: 5
\`\`\`

## Practice Examples

### Example: Grade Calculator

\`\`\`python
def calculate_grade(score):
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "F"

# Use the function
grade1 = calculate_grade(95)
grade2 = calculate_grade(75)

print("Score 95 gets grade", grade1)
print("Score 75 gets grade", grade2)
\`\`\`

## Try It Yourself

1. Create a function that prints your name
2. Make a function that adds two numbers
3. Write a function that calculates the area of a square
4. Create a function that greets someone by name
5. Build a function that checks if a number is even

## Important Notes

- Use \`def\` to define a function
- Function names should be descriptive
- Use parameters to pass information to functions
- Use \`return\` to give back a value
- Call functions by writing their name with parentheses
- Functions help organize and reuse code`,

      content: `# Python Lesson 8: Graphics & Turtle 🎨

## What is Turtle Graphics?

Turtle graphics lets you draw pictures using Python! You control a "turtle" that moves around and draws lines.

## Getting Started

First, you need to import the turtle module:

\`\`\`python
import turtle
\`\`\`

## Creating a Turtle

\`\`\`python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
\`\`\`

## Basic Drawing Commands

### Moving the Turtle

\`\`\`python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()

t.forward(100)  # Move forward 100 steps
t.backward(50)  # Move backward 50 steps
\`\`\`

### Turning

\`\`\`python
t.left(90)   # Turn left 90 degrees
t.right(45)  # Turn right 45 degrees
\`\`\`

### Drawing a Square

\`\`\`python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()

t.forward(100)
t.left(90)
t.forward(100)
t.left(90)
t.forward(100)
t.left(90)
t.forward(100)
\`\`\`

## Using Loops with Turtle

Drawing a square with a loop:

\`\`\`python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()

for i in range(4):
    t.forward(100)
    t.left(90)
\`\`\`

## Changing Colors

\`\`\`python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()

t.color("red")
t.forward(100)

t.color("blue")
t.forward(100)
\`\`\`

## Drawing Shapes

### Circle

\`\`\`python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.circle(50)  # Draw circle with radius 50
\`\`\`

### Star

\`\`\`python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()

for i in range(5):
    t.forward(100)
    t.right(144)  # 180 - (360/5) = 144
\`\`\`

## Pen Control

### Lifting the Pen

\`\`\`python
t.penup()    # Stop drawing
t.forward(50)
t.pendown()  # Start drawing again
t.forward(50)
\`\`\`

### Pen Size

\`\`\`python
t.pensize(5)  # Make line thicker
t.forward(100)
\`\`\`

## Filling Shapes

\`\`\`python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()

t.begin_fill()
t.color("red")

for i in range(4):
    t.forward(100)
    t.left(90)

t.end_fill()
\`\`\`

## Practice Examples

### Example 1: House

\`\`\`python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()

# Draw square (house)
for i in range(4):
    t.forward(100)
    t.left(90)

# Draw triangle (roof)
t.left(45)
t.forward(70)
t.right(90)
t.forward(70)
\`\`\`

### Example 2: Flower

\`\`\`python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.color("red")

for i in range(8):
    t.circle(30)
    t.left(45)
\`\`\`

### Example 3: Spiral

\`\`\`python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.speed(10)  # Make it faster

for i in range(50):
    t.forward(i * 2)
    t.left(90)
\`\`\`

## Try It Yourself

1. Draw a square
2. Draw a triangle
3. Draw a circle
4. Create a colorful pattern
5. Draw a simple house
6. Make a spiral pattern

## Important Notes

- Always \`import turtle\` first
- Create a turtle with \`turtle.Turtle()\`
- \`forward()\` moves forward
- \`left()\` and \`right()\` turn the turtle
- Use loops to repeat drawing commands
- Experiment with colors and sizes!`,

## Fusion Sketching Explained: How to Build Clean, Accurate Designs (Step 2)

**Topic**: 2D sketching basics, constraints, and dimensions.

**YouTube Video**: [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVSURhX8Qu0&list=PLc_LgFscXJeVnF7K_CwavgPwL_siJWMv7&index=2&pp=iAQB)



## What is a Sketch?



A sketch is a 2D drawing that forms the foundation of 3D models. In Fusion 360, you create 3D objects by starting with 2D sketches and then extruding, revolving, or sweeping them.



## Creating a Sketch



1. Click "Create Sketch" in the toolbar

2. Select a plane (XY, XZ, or YZ) or a face on an existing object

3. The sketch environment activates



## Sketch Tools

Creates straight lines between two points.



- Click to set start point

- Click again to set end point

- Press Escape to finish



### Rectangle Tool

Creates rectangles quickly.



- **2-Point Rectangle**: Click two opposite corners

- **3-Point Rectangle**: Define width, then height

- **Center Rectangle**: Click center, then corner



### Circle Tool

Creates circles.



- **Center Diameter**: Click center, drag to set radius

- **2-Point Circle**: Click two points on the circle

- **3-Point Circle**: Click three points



### Arc Tool

Creates curved segments.



- **3-Point Arc**: Start, end, and point on arc

- **Center Point Arc**: Center, start, end



## Constraints

Constraints define relationships between sketch elements:



- **Horizontal/Vertical**: Aligns lines to axes

- **Coincident**: Makes points touch

- **Parallel/Perpendicular**: Sets line relationships

- **Tangent**: Makes curves touch smoothly

- **Equal**: Makes dimensions the same

- **Dimension**: Sets exact measurements



## Dimensioning



Add dimensions to control sizes:



1. Click "Dimension" tool

2. Select the element to dimension

3. Click where to place the dimension

4. Enter the value



## Example: Drawing a Square



1. Create a new sketch on the XY plane

2. Use Rectangle tool to draw a rectangle

3. Add Equal constraint to make it square

4. Add Dimension to set size (e.g., 50mm)

5. Click "Finish Sketch"



## Important Notes



- Sketches must be fully constrained (black) before extruding

- Blue elements are under-constrained

- Red elements have conflicts

- Always finish your sketch before creating 3D features`,

## What is Extrude?



Extrude is the most fundamental 3D operation. It takes a 2D sketch and extends it into the third dimension, creating a 3D solid.



## Extrude Tool

Located in the Create menu, Extrude converts sketches into 3D objects.



## Types of Extrusion



### New Body

Creates a new separate solid body.



### Join

Adds material to an existing body.



### Cut

Removes material from an existing body.



### Intersect

Keeps only the overlapping volume.



## Extrusion Options



### Distance

Extrudes a specific distance in one direction.



- **One Side**: Extrudes in one direction only

- **Two Sides**: Extrudes equally in both directions

- **Symmetric**: Same as two sides



### To Object

Extrudes until it reaches another object or face.



### All

Extrudes through all objects in the path.



## Example: Creating a Box



1. Create a sketch with a rectangle (50mm x 30mm)

2. Finish the sketch

3. Click "Extrude"

4. Select the rectangle

5. Set distance to 20mm

6. Click OK



Result: A 50mm x 30mm x 20mm box!



## Other Basic 3D Features



### Revolve

Rotates a sketch around an axis to create cylindrical objects.



### Sweep

Moves a profile along a path.



### Loft

Creates a smooth transition between multiple profiles.



## Modifying Extrusions



After creating an extrude, you can:



- Edit it from the timeline

- Change the distance

- Switch between Join, Cut, and New Body

- Adjust the direction



## Best Practices



- Always fully constrain sketches before extruding

- Use descriptive names for your features

- Keep sketches simple - one feature per sketch when possible

- Use the timeline to edit past operations



## Important Notes



- Extrude only works on closed profiles (no gaps)

- Open profiles can be used for surfaces

- The direction arrow shows extrusion direction

- Negative distances extrude in opposite direction`,

## Understanding Constraints



Constraints are rules that control how sketch elements relate to each other. They ensure your sketch behaves predictably when you make changes.



## Geometric Constraints



These control the shape and relationships:



### Horizontal/Vertical

Forces lines to be perfectly horizontal or vertical.



### Parallel

Makes two or more lines parallel to each other.



### Perpendicular

Makes two lines meet at a 90-degree angle.



### Tangent

Makes a line or arc touch a curve smoothly.



### Coincident

Makes points or endpoints touch.



### Midpoint

Places a point at the middle of a line.



### Concentric

Makes circles or arcs share the same center point.



### Equal

Makes selected elements the same size.



### Symmetric

Makes elements mirror each other across a line.



## Dimensional Constraints



These control the size:



### Dimension Tool

Sets exact measurements.



- **Linear Dimension**: Distance between two points

- **Angular Dimension**: Angle between two lines

- **Radial Dimension**: Radius of circles/arcs

- **Diameter Dimension**: Diameter of circles



## Constraint Colors



- **Black**: Fully constrained (locked in place)

- **Blue**: Under-constrained (can still move)

- **Red**: Over-constrained (conflicts exist)

- **Orange**: Driven dimension (calculated, not set)



## Fully Constraining Sketches



A fully constrained sketch is black and cannot move. This is ideal because:



- Prevents accidental changes

- Makes your design predictable

- Required for parametric modeling



## Example: Constraining a Rectangle



1. Draw a rectangle (currently blue - under-constrained)

2. Add Horizontal constraint to top and bottom lines

3. Add Vertical constraint to side lines

4. Add Equal constraint to make it square

5. Add Dimension to set size (50mm)

6. Sketch turns black - fully constrained!



## Over-Constraining



Too many constraints create conflicts:



- Fusion 360 shows red elements

- You must remove conflicting constraints

- Check the warning message for guidance



## Best Practices



1. Add geometric constraints first

2. Then add dimensions

3. Constrain in logical order

4. Use constraints instead of dimensions when possible

5. Keep sketches simple and organized



## Important Notes



- Constraints are essential for parametric design

- Fully constrained sketches are more reliable

- You can delete constraints from the browser

- Use "Show Constraints" to see all active constraints`,

## What is Revolve?



Revolve rotates a 2D profile around an axis to create cylindrical, spherical, or toroidal (donut-shaped) objects.



## When to Use Revolve



Perfect for creating:

- Cylinders and tubes

- Bowls and cups

- Wheels and pulleys

- Bottles and containers

- Any rotationally symmetric object



## Revolve Tool

Located in the Create menu, similar to Extrude but creates rotational geometry.



## Creating a Revolve



1. Create a sketch with a profile (half the cross-section)

2. Draw an axis line (centerline) for rotation

3. Finish the sketch

4. Click "Revolve"

5. Select the profile

6. Select the axis

7. Set the angle (usually 360°)

8. Click OK



## Revolve Options



### Angle

- **360°**: Full rotation (most common)

- **Custom Angle**: Partial rotation (e.g., 90°, 180°)

- **To Object**: Revolve until reaching another object



### Operation Types

- **New Body**: Creates new solid

- **Join**: Adds to existing body

- **Cut**: Removes material

- **Intersect**: Keeps overlapping volume



## Example: Creating a Cylinder



1. Create sketch on XZ plane

2. Draw a rectangle (width = radius, height = cylinder height)

3. Draw a vertical line on the left as the axis

4. Finish sketch

5. Revolve the rectangle around the axis

6. Set angle to 360°

7. Result: Perfect cylinder!



## Example: Creating a Bowl



1. Create sketch on XZ plane

2. Draw the bowl profile (curved line)

3. Draw horizontal axis line at the top

4. Finish sketch

5. Revolve around the axis

6. Set angle to 360°

7. Result: Bowl shape!



## Important Rules



- The profile must not cross the axis

- Only one side of the axis should have the profile

- The axis can be a line in the sketch or an edge of the model

- Profile must be closed for solid bodies



## Combining Revolve with Other Features



You can:

- Revolve to create base shape

- Then extrude to add features

- Use Cut operation to remove material

- Create complex rotational parts



## Best Practices



- Always include the axis in your sketch

- Use construction lines for the axis

- Keep profiles simple

- Consider the final orientation of your part



## Important Notes



- Revolve creates rotationally symmetric objects

- The axis determines the center of rotation

- 360° creates complete objects

- Partial angles create segments`,

## What are Fillets and Chamfers?



Fillets and chamfers are edge modifications that make parts safer, stronger, and easier to manufacture.



## Fillet



A fillet creates a rounded corner or edge by adding material in a curved shape.



### Uses:

- Remove sharp edges (safety)

- Strengthen corners (reduce stress)

- Improve appearance

- Make parts easier to handle



## Chamfer



A chamfer creates a beveled (angled) edge by cutting material at an angle.



### Uses:

- Remove sharp edges

- Help with assembly (easier insertion)

- Reduce stress concentrations

- Create decorative edges



## Fillet Tool

Located in the Modify menu.



### Types:

- **Constant Radius**: Same radius along entire edge

- **Variable Radius**: Different radii at different points

- **Face Fillet**: Fillets between two faces



### Selecting Edges:

- Click individual edges

- Or select a face to fillet all its edges

- Hold Shift to add more edges



## Chamfer Tool

Also in the Modify menu.



### Types:

- **Distance**: Cuts equal distance on both sides

- **Distance and Angle**: Sets distance and angle

- **Two Distances**: Different distances on each side



## Example: Adding Fillets



1. Create a box (50mm x 30mm x 20mm)

2. Click "Fillet" tool

3. Select the edges you want to round

4. Set radius (e.g., 5mm)

5. Click OK



Sharp edges become smooth and rounded!



## Example: Adding Chamfers



1. Create a box

2. Click "Chamfer" tool

3. Select the edges

4. Set distance (e.g., 3mm)

5. Click OK



Sharp edges become beveled!



## Best Practices



### Fillets:

- Use larger radii for strength

- Smaller radii for appearance

- Apply to all sharp edges for safety

- Consider manufacturing constraints



### Chamfers:

- Use for assembly features

- Smaller chamfers for appearance

- Larger chamfers for functional purposes

- Consider the angle (usually 45°)



## Common Mistakes



- Making fillets/chamfers too large (weakens part)

- Forgetting to fillet internal corners

- Applying to wrong edges

- Not considering manufacturing limits



## Order of Operations



Apply fillets and chamfers:

- After main features are created

- Before final details

- In logical order (largest to smallest)

- Consider how they interact



## Important Notes



- Fillets add material, chamfers remove material

- Both improve part safety and manufacturability

- Can be applied to edges or faces

- Can be edited from the timeline

- Radius/distance can be changed later`,

## What is an Assembly?



An assembly is a collection of components (parts) that work together. Each component can move and interact with others.



## Components vs Bodies



- **Body**: A single solid object within a component

- **Component**: A container that can hold bodies and move independently

- **Assembly**: Multiple components working together



## Creating Components



1. Design your part

2. Right-click in browser

3. Select "Create Component"

4. Name your component

5. Move bodies into the component



## Joints

Joints define how components move relative to each other.



## Types of Joints



### Rigid Joint

Components are fixed together (no movement).



### Revolute Joint

Rotation around one axis (like a hinge).



### Slider Joint

Linear movement along one axis.



### Cylindrical Joint

Rotation and sliding along one axis.



### Pin-Slot Joint

Rotation around one axis, sliding along another.



### Planar Joint

Movement in a plane (2D movement).



### Ball Joint

Rotation in all directions (like a ball and socket).



## Creating a Joint



1. Click "Assemble" → "Joint"

2. Select first component (moving part)

3. Select second component (fixed part)

4. Choose joint type

5. Select geometry (faces, edges, points)

6. Set motion limits (optional)

7. Click OK



## Example: Hinge Assembly



1. Create two components (door and frame)

2. Create Revolute joint

3. Select door edge as rotation axis

4. Select frame edge as fixed axis

5. Door can now rotate!



## Motion Study

Test your assembly:



1. Click "Motion Study" workspace

2. Add motion to joints

3. Play animation

4. Check for collisions

5. Verify movement is correct



## As-Built Joints

For components already positioned:



1. Select components

2. Click "As-Built Joint"

3. Choose joint type

4. Fusion 360 maintains current position



## Best Practices



- Create components early in design

- Use appropriate joint types

- Test motion before finalizing

- Name components clearly

- Organize in browser



## Common Assembly Issues



- **Over-constrained**: Too many joints

- **Under-constrained**: Parts can move unexpectedly

- **Collisions**: Parts interfere with each other

- **Wrong joint type**: Movement doesn't match intent



## Important Notes



- Joints define relationships, not just position

- Components can have multiple joints

- Motion limits prevent unwanted movement

- Assemblies can be animated

- Joints can be edited from timeline`,

The main color of the material.



### Roughness

How smooth or rough the surface is (affects reflections).



### Metallic

Whether the material is metallic (affects how light reflects).



### Specular

Controls the shininess and highlights.



## Rendering Settings



### Quality

- **Draft**: Fast, lower quality

- **Final**: Slower, high quality

- **Maximum**: Best quality, very slow



### Resolution

- Higher resolution = better quality but slower

- Common: 1920x1080 (Full HD)

- Higher: 3840x2160 (4K)



## Creating a Render



1. Switch to Render workspace

2. Apply materials to your model

3. Set up scene and lighting

4. Position camera (use ViewCube)

5. Click "Render"

6. Wait for processing

7. Save the image



## Best Practices
