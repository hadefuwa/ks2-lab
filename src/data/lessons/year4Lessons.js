Let's learn to multiply larger numbers!



## What is Long Multiplication?



Long multiplication helps us multiply numbers with more than one digit.



## Example: 23 × 4



\`\`\`

23

×  4

---

92

\`\`\`



Step by step:

1. Multiply 4 × 3 = 12 (write 2, carry 1)

2. Multiply 4 × 2 = 8, add the carried 1 = 9

3. Answer: 92



## Example: 34 × 12



\`\`\`

 34

×  12

---

 68  (34 × 2)

+ 340  (34 × 10)

---

408

\`\`\`



## Practice



Try these:

- 45 × 6 = ?

- 23 × 7 = ?

- 56 × 8 = ?

- 34 × 9 = ?



## Fun Activities

Let's learn about fractions and decimals!



## Fractions



Fractions show parts of a whole.



- ½ = one half

- ¼ = one quarter

- ⅓ = one third

- ¾ = three quarters



## Decimals



Decimals are another way to show parts of a whole.



- 0.5 = half (same as ½)

- 0.25 = quarter (same as ¼)

- 0.75 = three quarters (same as ¾)

- 0.1 = one tenth



## Converting Fractions to Decimals



- ½ = 0.5 (1 ÷ 2 = 0.5)

- ¼ = 0.25 (1 ÷ 4 = 0.25)

- ⅓ = 0.333... (1 ÷ 3 = 0.333...)

- ¾ = 0.75 (3 ÷ 4 = 0.75)



## Place Value in Decimals



- 0.1 = one tenth

- 0.01 = one hundredth

- 0.001 = one thousandth



## Practice



Convert these:

- ½ to decimal

- ¼ to decimal

- ¾ to decimal

- 0.5 to fraction



## Fun Activities

## What is Python?

Python is a programming language that is easy to learn and fun to use! It's named after the Monty Python comedy group, not the snake (though the snake emoji is fun!).

## Why Learn Python?

- **Easy to Read**: Python code looks almost like English
- **Powerful**: Used by professionals to build websites, games, and apps
- **Fun**: You can create games, draw pictures, and solve puzzles
- **Popular**: Many companies use Python

## Installing Python

Before you can write Python code, you need to install Python on your computer.

### Steps:

1. Go to python.org
2. Download Python (version 3.x)
3. Run the installer
4. Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"
5. Click "Install Now"

## Running Python Code

There are different ways to run Python:

### Method 1: Python Shell (Interactive)

1. Open "Python" or "IDLE" from your programs
2. Type code directly
3. Press Enter to run

### Method 2: Python Files

1. Open a text editor (like Notepad or VS Code)
2. Write your code
3. Save as \`.py\` file (e.g., \`my_program.py\`)
4. Run it from the command line or double-click

## Your First Program

Let's write your very first Python program!

\`\`\`python
print("Hello, World!")
\`\`\`

**What does this do?**
- \`print()\` is a function that displays text
- The text in quotes is what gets shown
- Run this and you'll see: Hello, World!

## Try It Yourself

1. Open Python or a text editor
2. Type: \`print("Hello, World!")\`
3. Run it
4. Change the message to say hello to yourself!

      title: "Python Lesson 3: Variables & Data",
      emoji: '📦',
      content: `# Python Lesson 3: Variables & Data 📦

## What is a Variable?

A variable is like a box where you store information. You give the box a name and put something inside it.

## Creating Variables

\`\`\`python
name = "Alice"
age = 8
favorite_color = "blue"
\`\`\`

**What's happening?**
- \`name\` is the variable name
- \`=\` assigns a value
- \`"Alice"\` is the value stored

## Types of Data

### Strings (Text)

Text in quotes:

\`\`\`python
name = "Python"
greeting = "Hello"
message = "I love coding!"
\`\`\`

### Numbers (Integers)

Whole numbers:

\`\`\`python
age = 8
score = 100
count = 5
\`\`\`

### Numbers (Floats)

Decimal numbers:

\`\`\`python
height = 1.25
temperature = 36.5
price = 9.99
\`\`\`

## Using Variables

Once you create a variable, you can use it:

\`\`\`python
name = "Alice"
print("Hello,", name)
print(name, "is learning Python")
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
Hello, Alice
Alice is learning Python
\`\`\`

## Math with Variables

\`\`\`python
apples = 5
oranges = 3
total = apples + oranges

print("I have", total, "fruits")
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
I have 8 fruits
\`\`\`

## Changing Variables

You can change what's stored in a variable:

\`\`\`python
score = 10
print("Score:", score)

score = 20
print("New score:", score)
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
Score: 10
New score: 20
\`\`\`

## Variable Names

Good variable names:
- Use lowercase letters
- Use underscores for spaces
- Be descriptive

**Good examples:**
\`\`\`python
student_name = "Alice"
number_of_apples = 5
total_score = 100
\`\`\`

**Bad examples:**
\`\`\`python
x = "Alice"  # Not clear what x means
n = 5        # Not descriptive
\`\`\`

## Practice Examples

### Example 1: Personal Info

\`\`\`python
my_name = "Python Learner"
my_age = 8
my_school = "Code Academy"

print("Name:", my_name)
print("Age:", my_age)
print("School:", my_school)
\`\`\`

### Example 2: Shopping

\`\`\`python
apples = 3
bananas = 5
oranges = 2

total_fruits = apples + bananas + oranges
print("Total fruits:", total_fruits)
\`\`\`

### Example 3: Calculations

\`\`\`python
length = 10
width = 5
area = length * width

print("Length:", length)
print("Width:", width)
print("Area:", area)
\`\`\`

## Try It Yourself

1. Create variables for your name, age, and favorite color
2. Print them all
3. Create variables for two numbers and add them
4. Change a variable's value and print it again

## Important Notes

- Variables store information
- Use \`=\` to assign values
- Variable names should be clear and descriptive
- You can change variable values anytime
- Text needs quotes, numbers don't`,

    new Lesson({
      id: lessonId++,
      yearId: 'year4',
      subjectId: 'technology',
      lessonNumber: 4,
      title: "Python Lesson 4: Input & Interaction",
      emoji: '⌨️',
      content: `# Python Lesson 4: Input & Interaction ⌨️

## Making Programs Interactive

So far, our programs just display messages. Now let's make them interactive by getting input from the user!

## The Input Function

The \`input()\` function lets users type information into your program.

## Basic Input

\`\`\`python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello,", name)
\`\`\`

**What happens:**
1. Program asks: "What is your name? "
2. User types their name
3. Program says hello

## Getting Different Types of Input

### Text Input

\`\`\`python
favorite_color = input("What is your favorite color? ")
print("I like", favorite_color, "too!")
\`\`\`

### Number Input

**Important:** \`input()\` always returns text, even for numbers!

\`\`\`python
age = input("How old are you? ")
print("You are", age, "years old")
\`\`\`

To do math with numbers, convert them:

\`\`\`python
age = int(input("How old are you? "))
next_year = age + 1
print("Next year you will be", next_year)
\`\`\`

**Important:** Make sure the user enters a number! If they type text instead of a number, the program will show an error. For now, just remember to enter numbers when asked.

## Converting Input Types

### String to Integer

\`\`\`python
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
double = number * 2
print("Double is", double)
\`\`\`

### String to Float

\`\`\`python
price = float(input("Enter a price: "))
tax = price * 0.1
print("Tax is", tax)
\`\`\`

## Building Interactive Programs

### Example 1: Greeting Program

\`\`\`python
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")

print("Hello,", name)
print("You are", age, "years old")
print("Nice to meet you!")
\`\`\`

### Example 2: Calculator

\`\`\`python
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))

total = num1 + num2
print("The sum is", total)
\`\`\`

### Example 3: Story Maker

\`\`\`python
name = input("Enter a name: ")
place = input("Enter a place: ")
animal = input("Enter an animal: ")

print("Once upon a time,", name)
print("went to", place)
print("and met a", animal)
\`\`\`

## Combining Input and Variables

\`\`\`python
# Get information
name = input("What is your name? ")
favorite_food = input("What is your favorite food? ")
times_per_week = int(input("How many times per week do you eat it? "))

# Calculate
times_per_month = times_per_week * 4

# Display results
print(name, "eats", favorite_food, times_per_month, "times per month!")
\`\`\`

## Practice Examples

### Example: Personal Quiz

\`\`\`python
print("Let's learn about you!")

name = input("What is your name? ")
age = int(input("How old are you? "))
favorite_subject = input("What is your favorite subject? ")

print("\\nHere's what I learned:")
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Favorite subject:", favorite_subject)
\`\`\`

## Try It Yourself

1. Create a program that asks for your name and says hello
2. Make a simple calculator that adds two numbers
3. Create a story maker that asks for words and makes a story
4. Build a quiz about yourself

## Important Notes

- \`input()\` always returns text (strings)
- Use \`int()\` to convert to whole numbers
- Use \`float()\` to convert to decimal numbers
- Always provide clear prompts for users
- Test your programs with different inputs`,
      quizId: quizId++,
      assessmentType: 'quiz',
      categoryId: 'python',
    }),

    new Lesson({
      id: lessonId++,
      yearId: 'year4',
      subjectId: 'technology',
      lessonNumber: 5,
      title: "Python Lesson 5: Decisions (if statements)",
      emoji: '🤔',
      content: `# Python Lesson 5: Decisions (if statements) 🤔

## Making Choices

Programs need to make decisions, just like we do! Python uses \`if\` statements to make choices.

## Basic If Statement

\`\`\`python
age = 8

if age >= 8:
    print("You can ride the roller coaster!")
\`\`\`

**What's happening?**
- \`if\` checks a condition
- \`age >= 8\` means "age is 8 or more"
- If true, the code inside runs
- Notice the colon \`:\` and indentation!

## Comparison Operators

- \`==\` equals (is the same)
- \`!=\` not equals (is different)
- \`>\` greater than
- \`<\` less than
- \`>=\` greater than or equal
- \`<=\` less than or equal

## Examples

### Checking Numbers

\`\`\`python
score = 85

if score >= 80:
    print("Great job!")
\`\`\`

### Checking Text

\`\`\`python
color = input("What is your favorite color? ")

if color == "blue":
    print("Blue is a great color!")
\`\`\`

## If-Else Statements

Use \`else\` for when the condition is false:

\`\`\`python
age = 7

if age >= 8:
    print("You can ride!")
else:
    print("Sorry, you're too young")
\`\`\`

## If-Elif-Else

Use \`elif\` (else-if) for multiple conditions:

\`\`\`python
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("Excellent!")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Great job!")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Good work!")
else:
    print("Keep practicing!")
\`\`\`

## Multiple Conditions

### Using \`and\`

Both conditions must be true:

\`\`\`python
age = 10
has_ticket = True  # True means yes, False means no

if age >= 8 and has_ticket:
    print("You can enter!")
\`\`\`

**Note:** \`True\` and \`False\` are special values in Python. They represent yes/no or on/off states.

### Using \`or\`

Either condition can be true:

\`\`\`python
day = "Saturday"

if day == "Saturday" or day == "Sunday":
    print("It's the weekend!")
\`\`\`

## Practice Examples

### Example 1: Age Checker

\`\`\`python
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

if age >= 13:
    print("You are a teenager")
elif age >= 8:
    print("You are a child")
else:
    print("You are very young!")
\`\`\`

### Example 2: Grade Calculator

\`\`\`python
score = int(input("Enter your score: "))

if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
else:
    grade = "Keep trying!"

print("Your grade is", grade)
\`\`\`

### Example 3: Password Checker

\`\`\`python
password = input("Enter password: ")

if password == "python123":
    print("Access granted!")
else:
    print("Access denied!")
\`\`\`

## Try It Yourself

1. Create a program that checks if a number is positive or negative
2. Make a weather program that gives advice based on temperature
3. Build a simple password checker
4. Create a program that checks if you can vote (age 18+)

## Important Notes

- Always use a colon \`:\` after \`if\`, \`elif\`, and \`else\`
- Indent code inside if statements (use 4 spaces)
- \`==\` checks if equal, \`=\` assigns a value
- Use \`and\` for both conditions, \`or\` for either condition
- Test your conditions with different values`,

      emoji: '🔄',
      content: `# Python Lesson 6: Loops 🔄

## What are Loops?

Loops let you repeat code without typing it over and over. They make programs efficient and powerful!

## For Loops

A \`for\` loop repeats code a specific number of times.

### Counting

\`\`\`python
for i in range(5):
    print("Hello!")
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
\`\`\`

### Using Range

\`\`\`python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
0
1
2
3
4
\`\`\`

**Note:** \`range(5)\` goes from 0 to 4 (5 numbers total)

### Range with Start and End

\`\`\`python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
1
2
3
4
5
\`\`\`

### Range with Steps

\`\`\`python
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
0
2
4
6
8
\`\`\`

## Looping Through Lists

\`\`\`python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print("I like", fruit)
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
I like apple
I like banana
I like orange
\`\`\`

## While Loops

A \`while\` loop repeats as long as a condition is true.

### Basic While Loop

\`\`\`python
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print("Count is", count)
    count = count + 1
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
Count is 0
Count is 1
Count is 2
Count is 3
Count is 4
\`\`\`

### User Input Loop

\`\`\`python
answer = ""

while answer != "yes":
    answer = input("Do you want to continue? (yes/no): ")
    print("You said:", answer)
\`\`\`

## Nested Loops

Loops inside loops:

\`\`\`python
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(i, j)
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
0 0
0 1
1 0
1 1
2 0
2 1
\`\`\`

## Practice Examples

### Example 1: Countdown

\`\`\`python
for i in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(i)
print("Blast off!")
\`\`\`

### Example 2: Multiplication Table

\`\`\`python
number = 5

for i in range(1, 11):
    result = number * i
    print(number, "x", i, "=", result)
\`\`\`

### Example 3: Sum Numbers

\`\`\`python
total = 0

for i in range(1, 6):
    total = total + i
    print("Adding", i, "Total is now", total)

print("Final total:", total)
\`\`\`

### Example 4: Guessing Game

\`\`\`python
secret = 7
guess = 0

while guess != secret:
    guess = int(input("Guess the number (1-10): "))
    if guess < secret:
        print("Too low!")
    elif guess > secret:
        print("Too high!")

print("You got it!")
\`\`\`

## Try It Yourself

1. Print numbers from 1 to 10
2. Print the 5 times table
3. Create a program that counts from 10 down to 1
4. Make a guessing game
5. Print your name 5 times using a loop

## Important Notes

- \`for\` loops repeat a specific number of times
- \`while\` loops repeat while a condition is true
- Always indent code inside loops
- Be careful with \`while\` loops - make sure they can end! (Otherwise you'll get an infinite loop that never stops)
- Use \`range()\` to control how many times a loop runs`,

      title: "Python Lesson 7: Functions",
      emoji: '⚙️',
      content: `# Python Lesson 7: Functions ⚙️

## What are Functions?

Functions are reusable pieces of code. Instead of writing the same code over and over, you write it once in a function and use it whenever you need it!

## Why Use Functions?

- **Reuse code**: Write once, use many times
- **Organize code**: Break problems into smaller pieces
- **Easier to fix**: Change code in one place
- **Cleaner programs**: Makes code easier to read

## Creating Functions

### Basic Function

\`\`\`python
def greet():
    print("Hello!")
    print("Welcome to Python")

greet()
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
Hello!
Welcome to Python
\`\`\`

### Function with Parameters

Parameters are information you give to the function:

\`\`\`python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello,", name)
    print("Nice to meet you!")

greet("Alice")
greet("Bob")
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
Hello, Alice
Nice to meet you!
Hello, Bob
Nice to meet you!
\`\`\`

### Function with Return

Functions can give back (return) a value:

\`\`\`python
def add(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result

sum = add(5, 3)
print("The sum is", sum)
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
The sum is 8
\`\`\`

## Function Examples

### Example 1: Calculator Functions

\`\`\`python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

# Use the functions
result1 = add(10, 5)
result2 = subtract(10, 5)
result3 = multiply(10, 5)

print("10 + 5 =", result1)
print("10 - 5 =", result2)
print("10 * 5 =", result3)
\`\`\`

### Example 2: Greeting Function

\`\`\`python
def greet(name, age):
    print("Hello,", name)
    print("You are", age, "years old")
    print("Have a great day!")

greet("Alice", 8)
greet("Bob", 10)
\`\`\`

### Example 3: Area Calculator

\`\`\`python
def rectangle_area(length, width):
    area = length * width
    return area

def circle_area(radius):
    area = 3.14 * radius * radius
    return area

# Calculate areas
rect = rectangle_area(5, 3)
circle = circle_area(4)

print("Rectangle area:", rect)
print("Circle area:", circle)
\`\`\`

## Built-in Functions

Python has many built-in functions you can use:

\`\`\`python
# len() - get length
name = "Python"
print(len(name))  # Output: 6

# max() - get maximum
numbers = [5, 2, 8, 1]
print(max(numbers))  # Output: 8

# min() - get minimum
print(min(numbers))  # Output: 1

# abs() - absolute value
print(abs(-5))  # Output: 5
\`\`\`

## Practice Examples

### Example: Grade Calculator

\`\`\`python
def calculate_grade(score):
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "F"

# Use the function
grade1 = calculate_grade(95)
grade2 = calculate_grade(75)

print("Score 95 gets grade", grade1)
print("Score 75 gets grade", grade2)
\`\`\`

## Try It Yourself

1. Create a function that prints your name
2. Make a function that adds two numbers
3. Write a function that calculates the area of a square
4. Create a function that greets someone by name
5. Build a function that checks if a number is even

## Important Notes

- Use \`def\` to define a function
- Function names should be descriptive
- Use parameters to pass information to functions
- Use \`return\` to give back a value
- Call functions by writing their name with parentheses
- Functions help organize and reuse code`,

      emoji: '🎨',
      content: `# Python Lesson 8: Graphics & Turtle 🎨

## What is Turtle Graphics?

Turtle graphics lets you draw pictures using Python! You control a "turtle" that moves around and draws lines.

## Getting Started

First, you need to import the turtle module:

\`\`\`python
import turtle
\`\`\`

## Creating a Turtle

\`\`\`python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
\`\`\`

## Basic Drawing Commands

### Moving the Turtle

\`\`\`python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()

t.forward(100)  # Move forward 100 steps
t.backward(50)  # Move backward 50 steps
\`\`\`

### Turning

\`\`\`python
t.left(90)   # Turn left 90 degrees
t.right(45)  # Turn right 45 degrees
\`\`\`

### Drawing a Square

\`\`\`python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()

t.forward(100)
t.left(90)
t.forward(100)
t.left(90)
t.forward(100)
t.left(90)
t.forward(100)
\`\`\`

## Using Loops with Turtle

Drawing a square with a loop:

\`\`\`python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()

for i in range(4):
    t.forward(100)
    t.left(90)
\`\`\`

## Changing Colors

\`\`\`python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()

t.color("red")
t.forward(100)

t.color("blue")
t.forward(100)
\`\`\`

## Drawing Shapes

### Circle

\`\`\`python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.circle(50)  # Draw circle with radius 50
\`\`\`

### Star

\`\`\`python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()

for i in range(5):
    t.forward(100)
    t.right(144)  # 180 - (360/5) = 144
\`\`\`

## Pen Control

### Lifting the Pen

\`\`\`python
t.penup()    # Stop drawing
t.forward(50)
t.pendown()  # Start drawing again
t.forward(50)
\`\`\`

### Pen Size

\`\`\`python
t.pensize(5)  # Make line thicker
t.forward(100)
\`\`\`

## Filling Shapes

\`\`\`python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()

t.begin_fill()
t.color("red")

for i in range(4):
    t.forward(100)
    t.left(90)

t.end_fill()
\`\`\`

## Practice Examples

### Example 1: House

\`\`\`python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()

# Draw square (house)
for i in range(4):
    t.forward(100)
    t.left(90)

# Draw triangle (roof)
t.left(45)
t.forward(70)
t.right(90)
t.forward(70)
\`\`\`

### Example 2: Flower

\`\`\`python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.color("red")

for i in range(8):
    t.circle(30)
    t.left(45)
\`\`\`

### Example 3: Spiral

\`\`\`python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.speed(10)  # Make it faster

## Building Real Projects

Now that you've learned the basics, let's combine everything to build fun projects!

## Project 1: Number Guessing Game

**Note:** We use \`import random\` to get access to Python's random number functions. This lets us generate random numbers for our game!

\`\`\`python
import random

secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)
guesses = 0

print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100!")

while True:
    guess = int(input("Guess the number: "))
    guesses = guesses + 1
    
    if guess < secret_number:
        print("Too low! Try again.")
    elif guess > secret_number:
        print("Too high! Try again.")
    else:
        print("Congratulations! You got it in", guesses, "guesses!")
        break
\`\`\`

## Project 2: Simple Calculator

\`\`\`python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

def divide(a, b):
    return a / b

print("Simple Calculator")
print("1. Add")
print("2. Subtract")
print("3. Multiply")
print("4. Divide")

choice = input("Choose an operation (1-4): ")
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

if choice == "1":
    result = add(num1, num2)
elif choice == "2":
    result = subtract(num1, num2)
elif choice == "3":
    result = multiply(num1, num2)
elif choice == "4":
    result = divide(num1, num2)
else:
    result = "Invalid choice"

print("Result:", result)
\`\`\`

## Project 3: Quiz Game

\`\`\`python
score = 0

print("Welcome to the Python Quiz!")

# Question 1
answer1 = input("What is 5 + 3? ")
if answer1 == "8":
    print("Correct!")
    score = score + 1
else:
    print("Wrong! The answer is 8")

# Question 2
answer2 = input("What is the capital of France? ")
# .lower() converts the answer to lowercase so "Paris", "PARIS", and "paris" all work
if answer2.lower() == "paris":
    print("Correct!")
    score = score + 1
else:
    print("Wrong! The answer is Paris")

# Question 3
answer3 = input("What is 10 * 2? ")
if answer3 == "20":
    print("Correct!")
    score = score + 1
else:
    print("Wrong! The answer is 20")

print("\\nYour score:", score, "out of 3")
\`\`\`

## Project 4: Drawing a Pattern

\`\`\`python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.speed(10)

colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "purple"]

for i in range(36):
    t.color(colors[i % 5])
    for j in range(4):
        t.forward(50)
        t.left(90)
    t.left(10)

turtle.done()  # Keeps the window open so you can see your drawing
\`\`\`

## Project 5: Story Generator

\`\`\`python
print("Let's create a story!")

name = input("Enter a name: ")
place = input("Enter a place: ")
animal = input("Enter an animal: ")
verb = input("Enter an action (like 'run'): ")

print("\\nHere's your story:")
print("Once upon a time,", name)
print("went to", place)
print("and saw a", animal)
print("that liked to", verb)
print("The end!")

<!-- OPTIONS -->
Blue|Red|Green|Yellow
<!-- CORRECT -->
1
<!-- EXPLANATION -->
When you drag the extrude handle downwards into the block, the operation turns red, indicating a "Cut" operation. This removes material instead of adding it.
<!-- QUESTION_END -->



## Rectangular Pattern

To create multiple holes efficiently, the Rectangular Pattern tool is used instead of manually creating each hole.



### Object Type

Set to "Features" to select the cut extrusion from the timeline. This tells Fusion 360 to pattern the cut feature, not just the sketch.



### Directions

The axis is selected (edge of the block). The direction type is set to Symmetrical to pattern in both directions from the center. This creates a balanced pattern.



### Configuration

- **Axis 1**: Quantity 3 (total 3 in this row)

- **Axis 2**: Quantity 2 (creates a second row)

- **Distance**: Adjusted (e.g., 200mm) to space the holes evenly

This creates a 3x2 grid of holes (3 columns, 2 rows).



<!-- QUESTION_START -->
