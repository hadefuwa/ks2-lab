Let's learn about place value up to millions!

## Place Value Positions

In the number 456,789:
- The 4 is in the hundred thousands place (worth 400,000)
- The 5 is in the ten thousands place (worth 50,000)
- The 6 is in the thousands place (worth 6,000)
- The 7 is in the hundreds place (worth 700)
- The 8 is in the tens place (worth 80)
- The 9 is in the ones place (worth 9)

## Examples

- 234,567 = 2 hundred thousands + 3 ten thousands + 4 thousands + 5 hundreds + 6 tens + 7 ones
- 1,000,000 = one million

Let's learn to add and subtract fractions!

## Adding Fractions

Make denominators the same, then add numerators!

## Examples

- 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4
- 1/3 + 1/6 = 2/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2
- 2/5 + 1/5 = 3/5

## Subtracting Fractions

Make denominators the same, then subtract numerators!

## Examples

- 3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4 = 1/2
- 5/6 - 1/6 = 4/6 = 2/3

      content: `# Percentages 📊

Let's learn about percentages!

## What are Percentages?

Percentages are parts out of 100!

## Examples

- 50% = 50 out of 100 = 1/2
- 25% = 25 out of 100 = 1/4
- 75% = 75 out of 100 = 3/4
- 100% = all of it

## Converting

- 1/2 = 50%
- 1/4 = 25%
- 3/4 = 75%

Let's learn about coordinates!

## What are Coordinates?

Coordinates tell us where a point is on a grid!

## Reading Coordinates

- (3, 4) means: 3 across, 4 up
- First number = x (across)
- Second number = y (up)

## Examples

- (2, 3) = 2 across, 3 up
- (5, 1) = 5 across, 1 up
- (0, 0) = origin (starting point)

Let's learn about symmetry!

## What is Symmetry?

A shape is symmetrical if both sides match!

## Line of Symmetry

A line that divides a shape into two matching halves!

## Examples

- A square has 4 lines of symmetry
- A rectangle has 2 lines of symmetry
- A circle has many lines of symmetry

Let's learn about volume!

## What is Volume?

Volume is the space inside a 3D shape!

## Finding Volume

For a cube or rectangular prism:
Volume = length × width × height

## Examples

- A cube with sides of 3 = 3 × 3 × 3 = 27 cubic units
- A box 4 × 2 × 3 = 24 cubic units

## How to Play

- 10 mm = 1 cm
- 100 cm = 1 m
- 1000 m = 1 km

## Mass Conversions

- 1000 g = 1 kg

## Capacity Conversions

- 1000 mL = 1 L

## Examples

      content: `# Mean, Median, Mode 📊

Let's learn about averages!

## Mean (Average)

Add all numbers, then divide by how many!

Example: 5, 7, 9
Mean = (5 + 7 + 9) ÷ 3 = 21 ÷ 3 = 7

## Median

The middle number when ordered!

Example: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11
Median = 7 (middle number)

## Mode

The number that appears most often!

Example: 2, 3, 3, 4, 5
Mode = 3 (appears twice)
