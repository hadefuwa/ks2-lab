Let's learn about algebra!



## What is Algebra?



Algebra uses letters (like x, y) to represent unknown numbers.



## Simple Equations



**Example:**

x + 5 = 10

- What number plus 5 equals 10?

- x = 5



**Example:**

y - 3 = 7

- What number minus 3 equals 7?

- y = 10



## Solving Equations



To solve an equation, find the value of the letter.



**Steps:**

1. Look at the equation

2. Do the opposite operation

3. Check your answer



**Example:**

x + 4 = 9

- Opposite of +4 is -4

- x = 9 - 4

- x = 5

- Check: 5 + 4 = 9 ✓



## Using Variables



Variables can represent any number.



- If x = 3, then x + 2 = 5

- If y = 7, then y - 4 = 3

- If a = 5, then a × 2 = 10



## Practice



Solve these:

- x + 3 = 8

- y - 5 = 10

- a + 7 = 15

- b - 2 = 9



## Fun Activities



- Practice solving equations

- Create your own equations

- Use algebra in word problems

- Play algebra games



## Remember



- Letters represent numbers

- Do opposite operations

- Check your answers

- Algebra is useful!`,
