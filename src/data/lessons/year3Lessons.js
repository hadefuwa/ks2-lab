      content: `# Prehistoric Britain - Stone Age to Iron Age 🪨

Welcome to a journey through 10,000 years of British history! Before the Romans arrived, Britain went through three major periods of change.

## 1. The Stone Age (Early Britain)
Technically split into the Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic.
- **Hunter-Gatherers**: Early humans followed herds of mammoths and deer.
- **Flint Tools**: Discovering that flint could be chipped into sharp axes and spears was a turning point.
- **First Farmers**: Eventually, people learned to plant seeds and keep animals, leading to the first permanent villages like Skara Brae.

## 2. The Bronze Age (Building and Settling)
- **Metalworking**: Around 2500 BC, people learned to mix copper and tin to make **Bronze**.
- **Roundhouses**: People lived in circular wooden homes with thatched roofs.
- **Stonehenge**: Many of the great stone monuments were completed or used during this time.

## 3. The Iron Age (Forts and Warriors)
- **Stronger Metal**: Iron was much harder than bronze, allowing for better plows and sharper weapons.
- **Hill Forts**: To protect themselves from rival tribes, people built massive earthwork forts on hills (like Maiden Castle).
- **Celtic Culture**: This was the time of the Celts, known for their beautiful jewelry (torcs) and fierce warriors.

## The Evolution of Technology
In the game, you will need to find the key inventions of each age to "evolve" your civilization to the next period!`,

      content: `# Genetics and Family Trees - The First Families 🧬

Let's learn about genetics through the story of the first families!

## The Story of Twins

In the beginning, God created the first families. Some families had twins - two children who looked very similar!

In this game, you'll learn how traits like eye color, hair color, and height are passed from parents to children.

## How to Play

1. **Match the Couples**: Drag boys to girls to create married couples
2. **Explore Genetics**: See how traits combine using Punnett squares
3. **Take a Quiz**: Answer questions about what children might look like

## What You'll Learn

- **Dominant vs Recessive**: Some traits are stronger than others
- **Genotypes and Phenotypes**: The difference between genes and appearance
- **Family Trees**: How traits are passed through generations
- **Probability**: What combinations are possible in children

## The Science

Just like the Haribo genetics meme, when twins marry twins, their children can have many different combinations of traits!

**Eye Color**: Brown eyes (B) are dominant over blue eyes (b)
**Hair Shade**: Dark hair (D) is dominant over blonde hair (d)
**Height**: Tall (T) is dominant over short (t)

## Remember

Every person is unique, created by God with special combinations of traits!`,

      content: `# Ancient Rome - The Empire 🏛️

Rome grew from a small town in Italy into one of the largest and most powerful empires the world has ever seen. This was possible because Romans were brilliant engineers and organized leaders.

## Key Roman Innovations
- **Aqueducts**: Huge stone bridges that carried fresh water for miles from the mountains into the city. Gravity did all the work!
- **Roman Roads**: They built 50,000 miles of straight, paved roads. This allowed their armies to move quickly and merchants to trade goods easily.
- **Concrete**: Romans invented a special type of concrete that was so strong it could even set underwater! This allowed them to build massive structures like the Colosseum.

## The Roman Army
The backbone of the empire was the **Roman Legions**. These were professional, highly disciplined soldiers who wore strong armor and fought in perfect formation. They didn't just fight; they also built many of the empire's roads and bridges.

## Rule and Culture
Rome was ruled by **Emperors** who held absolute power. The official language was **Latin**, which is the ancestor of Spanish, French, Italian, and many English words!

In the game, you will take on the role of an **Empire Architect**. You must choose the right Roman innovations to solve the problems of the city and help the Emperor expand our borders!`,

What was it like to wake up in the city of Rome 2,000 years ago? For some it was a life of luxury, but for most, it was a busy, crowded, and exciting world.

## Roman Homes: Villas vs. Insulae
- **Rich Romans** lived in beautiful houses called **Villas**. They had inner courtyards (Atriums), floor heating (Hypocausts), and even running water!
- **Poor Romans** lived in tall apartment blocks called **Insulae**. These were often made of wood and were very crowded. There were no kitchens or toilets inside!

## The Social Heart: Public Baths
The baths were more than just a place to get clean. They were a social club. Romans went there to exercise, gossip about politics, listen to poetry, and relax in different temperature pools.

## Food and Dining
Romans didn't sit at tables to eat fancy meals; they reclined on couches! Most people ate simple food like bread, porridge, and olives. They loved a salty fish sauce called **Garum**, which they put on almost everything.

## Great Entertainment
Rome was famous for "Bread and Circuses"—food and games to keep the people happy.
- **The Colosseum**: Where gladiators fought for glory.
- **Circus Maximus**: A massive track for high-speed, dangerous chariot races.

In the game, you will explore the streets of Rome and visit these famous locations to witness daily life yourself!`,

      content: `# The Fall of Rome ⚔️

No empire lasts forever. After hundreds of years of power, the Roman Empire began to decline. It didn't happen overnight; it was a slow process caused by many different problems working together.

## Why did the Giant Fall?
1. **Size**: The empire was so large it was almost impossible to defend. News traveled slowly by horse, meaning the Emperor often didn't know about an attack until it was too late.
2. **Economic Collapse**: The army was incredibly expensive to maintain. To pay for it, Rome printed more money, but this caused **Inflation**—where money loses its value and prices go up.
3. **Invasions**: Hungry and powerful tribes from outside Rome, like the **Goths**, **Vandals**, and **Huns**, began attacking the borders.

## The Final Blow
In **AD 476**, the last Roman Emperor in the West was overthrown by a tribal leader. While the Western Empire fell into the "Dark Ages," Roman influence never truly disappeared. Their laws, buildings, and language changed the world forever.

In the game, you will handle the difficult challenges of the late empire. Can you make the choices needed to try and save Rome?`,
