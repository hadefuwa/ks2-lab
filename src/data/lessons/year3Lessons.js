## How to Play



Tap the numbers to hear them! Then play the game! 🎮



## What is Division?



Division is sharing or grouping numbers!

When we divide, we split a number into equal groups.



## Examples



8 ÷ 2 = 4

This means: 8 shared equally into 2 groups = 4 in each group



10 ÷ 5 = 2

This means: 10 shared equally into 5 groups = 2 in each group



12 ÷ 3 = 4

This means: 12 shared equally into 3 groups = 4 in each group



## Practice



- Learn to divide by 2, 3, 4, and 5

- Practice sharing numbers equally

10p     10p     5p      2p       1p



**Step-by-Step Calculation:**



**Step 1:** Add 10p coins

⚪⚪ + ⚪⚪ = 20p

**Step 2:** Add the rest

20p + ⚪ + 🪙🪙 + 🪙 = 20 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 28p



**Answer:** You have **28 pence (28p)** 💰



### Example 2: Making £1 (Visual)



How many 10p coins make £1?



**Visual Representation:**



£1 = 100p

We need: ⚪⚪ ⚪⚪ ⚪⚪ ⚪⚪ ⚪⚪ ⚪⚪ ⚪⚪ ⚪⚪ ⚪⚪ ⚪⚪

                   = 50p total

**Toy Cost:**          45p 💸



**Step-by-Step:**



**Step 1:** Count your money

⚪⚪⚪⚪ + ⚪⚪⚪⚪ + ⚪⚪ = 20 + 20 + 10 = 50p

**Step 2:** Compare

50p > 45p ✓ (You have enough!)

**Step 3:** Calculate change

50p - 45p = 5p change



**Answer:** Yes, you can buy it! You'll get **5p change**! 🎉
