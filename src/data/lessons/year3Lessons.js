- 2 × 2 = 4

- 2 × 3 = 6

- 2 × 4 = 8

- 2 × 5 = 10

- 2 × 6 = 12

- 2 × 7 = 14

- 2 × 8 = 16

- 2 × 9 = 18

- 2 × 10 = 20



## The 5 Times Table



- 5 × 1 = 5

- 5 × 2 = 10

- 5 × 3 = 15

- 5 × 4 = 20

- 5 × 5 = 25

- 5 × 6 = 30

- 5 × 7 = 35

- 5 × 8 = 40

- 5 × 10 = 50



## Practice



Try these:

- 2 × 6 = ?

- 5 × 4 = ?
